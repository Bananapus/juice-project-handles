# Juicebox Project Handles

The JBProjectHandles contract manages reverse records that point from JB project IDs to ENS nodes. If the reverse record of a project ID is pointed to an ENS node with a TXT record matching the ID of that project, then the ENS node will be considered the "handle" for that project.
