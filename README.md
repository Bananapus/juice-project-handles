# Juicebox Project Handles

Juicebox projects can use an ENS address as their project's "handle" in frontend clients like [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money). To make this association, they must first set their `juicebox_project` ENS text record to their project's ID.

This `JBProjectHandles` contract manages reverse records that point from project IDs to ENS nodes.

## Develop

`juice-project-handles` uses the [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) development toolchain for builds, tests, and deployments. To get set up, install [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry):

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | sh
```

You can download and install dependencies with:

```bash
forge install
```

If you run into trouble with `forge install`, try using `git submodule update --init --recursive` to ensure that nested submodules have been properly initialized.

Some useful commands:
